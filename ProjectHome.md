**BOREDOM DISCLAIMER
This project is about RC (Radio Controlled modeling) stuff. If you're not an RC enthusiast, you probably wont be interested in.**

Some Castle Creations ESC are capable of sending live telemetry data back along the throttle channel. This project is about software useful to implement specific interfaces to listen CastleLinkLive data and do whatever you want with it.

  * *** SAFETY NOTICE
  * Always keep in mind that an electric motor can be dangerous for you, for
  * people and for things. It can start at any time if there is power.
  * Castle Creations ESC are very good ones, and have many security
  * strategies to avoid accidental and unwanted motor start.
  * Software in this project also try to keep things as safe as
  * possible, but using them together with an Arduino (or similar) board
  * connected to an electric power system adds another possible point of
  * failure to your motor control chain.
  * So please stay always on the safe side. If you have any doubts, ask
  * other modelers to help.
  * It's your responsibility to keep things safe. Developers of this software
  * can't be considered liable for any possible damage will result from its use.
